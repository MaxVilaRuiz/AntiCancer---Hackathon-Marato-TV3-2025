# AntiCancer---Hackathon-Marato-TV3-2025

**BrainMate** – This application is designed to evaluate and support cognitive functioning in cancer patients who may experience cognitive impairments. It focuses on four core cognitive domains: memory, processing speed, attention, and alternating verbal fluency.

The app provides two types of measurements: Objective and Subjective.

Objective measurements are taken through four game-like activities, which provide point-in-time assessments of the patient’s cognitive abilities across the four domains.

Subjective measurements consist of a daily self-reported questionnaire, allowing patients to communicate their perceived cognitive state. This enables doctors to monitor the patient’s real condition without exclusively relying on verbal reports, which may sometimes be inaccurate.

Based on the combined results from both types of measurements, the app generates personalized recommendations to address any detected deficits, helping patients improve their cognitive functioning.
